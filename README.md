A 'blank' flash for a Husarion Core2-ROS attached to an Asus Tinker board. As of November 13th, 2017, the Husarion team is troubleshooting an issue with the Core2-ROS boards when paired with an Asus Tinker board. During boot-up, after initial pairing of the Core2 with the Husarion Cloud service, the Core2 boots significantly faster than the Asus Tinker, and this gets the Asus Tinker 'locked' into it's bootloop.

### Adding a delay to the intialization of the Asus Tinker is a quick and dirty way of solving [avoiding] this problem.

11/13/2017 - presently a WIP and does not properly work. Do not anticipate much trouble getting it to work, it's just late here. I'll tackle it again tomorrow based on feedback from the Husarion team
